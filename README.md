This project is a research paper that was written in Saclay, France, to answer the follwing question:

> what is the worse stairway between Lozere and Le Guichet ?

If you don't know what it is about, it is an endless debate between students on the best way to go from the School Campus ([here](https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=plateau%20de%20saclay&addon=firefox&addonversion=4.1.0&method=topbar)) to the nearest city-train station.
